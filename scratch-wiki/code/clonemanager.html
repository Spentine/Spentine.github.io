<h1> Clone Manager </h1>

<p> Code: </p>

<p class="code">when gf clicked
delete all of [activecloneids v] :: list
delete all of [lastactive v] :: list
set [past v] to ()
set [cloneid v] to (0)
forever
check clones
wait (0) seconds :: control
end

define check clones
set [number of clones v] to (0)
set [overwritepast v] to ()
set [index v] to (0)
repeat (length of [lastactive v])
change [index v] by (1)
set [overwritepast v] to (join (overwritepast) (item (index) of [lastactive v]))
if <(item (index) of [activecloneids v]) = (1)> then
if <(item (index) of [lastactive v]) = (letter (index) of (past))> then
replace item (index) of [activecloneids v] with (0)
else
change [number of clones v] by (1)
end
end
end
set [past v] to (overwritepast)

when I start as a clone
set [cloneid v] to (item # of (0) in [activecloneids v] :: list)
if <(cloneid) = (0)> then
add (1) to [activecloneids v]
add (0) to [lastactive v]
set [cloneid v] to (length of [activecloneids v])
else
replace item (cloneid) of [activecloneids v] with (1)
end
forever
replace item (cloneid) of [lastactive v] with ((1) - (item (cloneid) of [lastactive v]))
wait (0) seconds :: control
end</p>

<p> In order to get the X and Y positions of clones, you can do this </p>

<p class="code">when gf clicked
delete all of [activecloneids v] :: list
delete all of [lastactive v] :: list
delete all of [Clones X v] :: list
delete all of [Clones Y v] :: list
set [past v] to ()
set [cloneid v] to (0)
forever
check clones
wait (0) seconds :: control
end

define check clones
set [number of clones v] to (0)
set [overwritepast v] to ()
set [index v] to (0)
repeat (length of [lastactive v])
change [index v] by (1)
set [overwritepast v] to (join (overwritepast) (item (index) of [lastactive v]))
if <(item (index) of [activecloneids v]) = (1)> then
if <(item (index) of [lastactive v]) = (letter (index) of (past))> then
replace item (index) of [activecloneids v] with (0)
else
change [number of clones v] by (1)
end
end
end
set [past v] to (overwritepast)

when I start as a clone
set [cloneid v] to (item # of (0) in [activecloneids v] :: list)
if <(cloneid) = (0)> then
add (1) to [activecloneids v]
add (x position) to [Clones X v]
add (y position) to [Clones Y v]
add (0) to [lastactive v]
set [cloneid v] to (length of [activecloneids v])
else
replace item (cloneid) of [activecloneids v] with (1)
replace item (cloneid) of [Clones X v] with (x position)
replace item (cloneid) of [Clones Y v] with (y position)
end
forever
replace item (cloneid) of [lastactive v] with ((1) - (item (cloneid) of [lastactive v]))
replace item (cloneid) of [Clones X v] with (x position)
replace item (cloneid) of [Clones Y v] with (y position)
wait (0) seconds :: control
end</p>

<p> Alternatively, you can do this: </p>

<p class="code">when gf clicked
delete all of [activeclones v] :: list

when i start as a clone
set [cloneid v] to (item # of (0) in [activeclones v] :: list)
if <(cloneid) = (0)> then
add (1) to [activeclones v]
set [cloneid v] to (length of [activeclones v])
else
replace item (cloneid) of [activeclones v] with (1)
end

define delete this clone
replace item (cloneid) of [activeclones v] with (0)
delete this clone</p>
  
  <p> Starting from the alternative code, you could track the clones' X and Y positions using this code: </p>
  
  <p class="code">when gf clicked
delete all of [activeclones v] :: list
delete all of [Clones X v] :: list
delete all of [Clones Y v] :: list

when i start as a clone
set [cloneid v] to (item # of (0) in [activeclones v] :: list)
if <(cloneid) = (0)> then
add (1) to [activeclones v]
set [cloneid v] to (length of [activeclones v])
else
replace item (cloneid) of [activeclones v] with (1)
end
forever
replace item (cloneid) of [Clones X v] with (x position)
replace item (cloneid) of [Clones Y v] with (y position)
end

define delete this clone
replace item (cloneid) of [activeclones v] with (0)
delete this clone</p>
