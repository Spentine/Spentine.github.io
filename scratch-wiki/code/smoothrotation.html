<h1> Smooth Rotation </h1>

<p> Code: </p>

<p class="code">turn cw ((((((target direction) - (direction)) + (180)) mod (360)) - (180)) / (smoothness)) degrees</p>

</body>

<p> The alternate code can be used instead. </p>

<p class="code">turn ccw (target direction) degrees
turn cw ((target direction) - ((direction) / (smoothness))) degrees</p>

<p>Essentially, Scratch automatically adds 180, mods 360, and subtracts 180 when setting a direction. We can take advantage of this by using setting the direction of (target direction - direction) beforehand. Now, in order to add this to the current direction, we must use (target direction - direction) again, which would cancel out the old target direction and set the direction back to normal. Now, it's [set direction to (target direction - direction), set direction to (target direction - direction + (direction / smoothness))]. The next optimization can come from making the first statement negative. This would allow us to use the [turn cw () degrees] or [turn ccw () degrees] block. We simply make every occurence of "direction" in the next line negative. Once we do that, we have [point in direction (direction - target direction) degrees] which can simply be [turn ccw (target direction) degrees], and the second line will become [point in direction (target direction + direction + (-direction / smoothness))], which can be simplified to [turn cw (direction - (direction / smoothness))].</p>
