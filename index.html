<h2> About Me </h2>
<p> &emsp; I am a computer programmer from the United States. I frequently go on the programming website Scratch to help Scratchers on the forums, mostly because I'm bored. I know a bit of JavaScript and Python, and a bit more HTML and CSS. I enjoy mathematics, not just because of its practicality in my programming, but also because of its beauty. </p>

<br>

<h2> Hobbies </h2>
<p> &emsp; I am also a music composer. I've created some music for my game, Quadtris. I use onlinesequencer because it's quite easy to get a hang of, and the melodies can then be further improved when ported to a DAW such as bandlab. I haven't created that many songs, but I will make more. I'm still improving, though. <br> &emsp; I also enjoy creating some simple art for my game. It's quite simple UI design, no characters, organic objects, nothing like that. Just rounded off squares with a simplified image on it. I want to learn how to draw Pok√©mon, but I don't have the motivation to do so.</p>

<br>

<h2> Creations </h2>
<p> &emsp; I've created many projects, but a lot of them are low effort, they usually take about 30 minutes to an hour to create. However, some of my best projects include <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/623978865/">Quadtris</a>, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/715479426/">Conway's Soldiers</a>, and this sweet <a href="https://onlinesequencer.net/2498228">Tetris Soundtrack</a> I made. </p>
