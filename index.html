<h2> About Me </h2>
<p> &emsp; I am a programmer focused on improving and expanding my skillset in computer science and mathematics. I am planning to more frequently develop projects that showcase my skill. In order to successfully attain a job as a programmer, I must have a wide variety of tools that will allow myself to act as a team of developers rather than just one. Schoolwork may reduce the amount of time I am able to dedicate towards this goal, but my persistence will get me through. </p>

<br>

<h2> Hobbies </h2>
<p> &emsp; I don't have many hobbies due to the lack of usage or ideas, but I know how to compose music and simple UI elements. </p>

<br>

<h2> Creations </h2>
<p> &emsp; Many of the projects I've created are quite insignificant, so for the time being, I won't list anything. Once I create a project that is meaningful, I will list it. </p>
